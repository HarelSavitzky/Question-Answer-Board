<h2>Execution</h2>
<p>The submission is a intellij servlet project</p>

<h2>Assumptions</h2>
<p>The program use Jsoup packages.</p>

<h2>Program Explanation</h2>
<p>in this program we will build a servlet project, we will build a site that will hold questions and<br>
    the user would be able to reply on them and to display the answers if he wish.<br>
</p>

<h2>Design Explanation</h2>
<p>the program designed in a modular way, each servlet/function got its own responsibility,<br>
*questionServlet - the main servlet, initializing the runTimeData (class that function as database), and extracting<br>
the questions and number of answers to each answer in order to return it to the script file that builds the<br>
questions on that page dynamically.<br>
*answerServlet - this servlet is being called if we press on "answer" button, or if we want to submit the answer<br>
if we press the answer button the page will be build dynamically and we will move there, if we press submit<br>
we will extract the name and the answer, we will save them in the database class, than we will be redirected to the<br>
index page.
*getAnswers - a servlet that is being called when we press on "show answers", than the servlet extract the data<br>
(questions + answers) and return in to the index script page in order to build the answers display dynamically.<br>
*runTimeData - a class that functions as our database, it saves data on the program runtime only, it has several<br>
functions in order to manage the data. we will create a single object from this class, that will be used from all<br>
the servlets on the program (in the exact same one..).<br>
*index.html - our landing page.<br>
*readme.html - our readme page.<br>
*formJs.js - the form script file.<br>
*indexJs.js - our landing page (question page) script file.<br>
*questions.txt - the questions file.<br>
*styles.css - CSS file.<br>

<h2>Other Notes</h2>
-----------

<h2>Exceptions</h2>
our main servlet "questionsServlet" will have a "try""catch" block, and will catch the necesary exceptions<br>
